# CRESSIDA - Polymarket-Inspired Static Prediction Market Prototype

CRESSIDA is a static prototype of a prediction market platform, inspired by Polymarket. It was developed as a portfolio project for the Human-Computer Interaction module (HCIN6222) by Uhone Justin Mukwevho (ST10101766).

**Live Demo:** https://justin-mukwevho.github.io/CRESSIDA/

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates front-end web development skills using only client-side technologies. The goal was to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface that simulates the core features of a prediction market.

## Features

* **Market Listings:** Browse, search, and filter prediction markets.
* **Market Details:** View price history charts (using Chart.js), order books (simulated), and market information.
* **Simulated Trading:** "Buy" YES or NO shares for markets (no real transactions, data is not persisted beyond the session).
* **User Profiles:** Simulated user accounts with balances and portfolios.
* **Registration & Login:** Client-side simulation using browser cookies for session management.
* **Leaderboard:** Display of top (hardcoded) traders.
* **Dark/Light Theme Toggle.**
* **Static Info Pages:** About, Terms (Placeholder), Privacy (Placeholder).

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure.
* **CSS3:** Custom styling, Flexbox, Grid, CSS Variables for theming.
* **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** All interactivity, DOM manipulation, simulated logic.
* **Chart.js:** For rendering price charts.
* **Font Awesome:** For icons.

**Note:** This is a purely static website. All data is hardcoded in JavaScript files. There is no backend, database, or server-side processing.

## Setup and Deployment

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone [https://github.com/Justin-Mukwevho/CRESSIDA]`
2.  No build process is required.
3.  To run locally, it's recommended to use a local web server (e.g., VS Code's Live Server extension, because features like cookies work more reliably over the `http://` protocol than `file:///`.
4.  The project is configured for deployment on GitHub Pages.
